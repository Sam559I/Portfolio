Final version slightly modified from original design for better functionality and overall better finished product. 

Through a series of modifications and adjustments, the emphasis has been placed on simplicity as a guiding principle. This deliberate choice ensures that the end product not only fulfills its intended objectives but also resonates more closely with my personal preferences and aesthetic sensibilities. 

By streamlining the design and eliminating unnecessary complexities, we have achieved a harmonious balance between form and function, resulting in a more intuitive and user-friendly solution.
